		<h2>Presentation</h2>
		<p>Lulu, the small girl at the right on the image just above is a very caring and empathetic young witch, although she is usually in these thoughts.
		   She holds her power from helping a small wounded bird who was actually a fairy spirit. He gave her a spiral stick that allowed him to grow leaves and flowers. 
		   And this is where her love for nature and her adventure begins, with this fairytale spirit name Pix. At the height of happiness, she discovers that she could 
		   reshape her environment at will but also alter her own form. She then brought to life everything that her vivid imagination could conceive in a clearing that defies 
		   all logic and where the laws of the material world didn't fully apply. But one fine day she woke up as if this whole story was just a dream, but convinced that it was real, 
		   she half in quest to find this magnificent glade where she had enjoyed the time spent. Although Lulu tries to get back to the glade and never succeeds, she keeps smiling, 
		   because every day is for her a new fun adventure. As you can see in the two videos under, the portal to get to Bundle, where Lulu got after her encounter with Pix, permanently 
		   teleports to appear in a way new area of the Runeterra's world

		<h2>Historical & societal context</h2>
		<p>With the launch of the Yordle's expedition in League of Legends in march 2012, the most ambitious event since the creation of the game in 2009,
		   a bunch of fairy characters appeared. Lulu was the first one to appear, with this event's launch. The players will then be able to unlock the others Yordle in the History.
		   Such as Corki, Teemo, Tristana, Veigar and some others in the next years. The League of Legends's team always wanted his game to have a huge part of history, here is why they created
		   the lore, which is the history of all the characters & the link between them all. The League of Legend games aim to create new characters on a regular basis. Their ambition being to create a story, 
		   that belongs to them around each new heros. This universe of witchcraft is adequate to make the community appreciate this new character. Especially, since the witch fits perfectly into the universe 
		   that the games try to represent. On the same period, some well appreciated by the society films came out, such as "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2" which came out in July 2011, they might 
		   have also been inspired by the Smurfs, with a film that came out in August 2011. We can imagine that as the Yordle's are some small characters & the fact you need to cross a portal to get into their magical world.
